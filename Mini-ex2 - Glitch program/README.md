# Glitch program
[Runme.Html](https://rawgit.com/GustneGustav/Rasmus-er-sej-og-flot/master/Mini-ex2%20-%20Glitch%20program/RUNME.html)

The program consists of 16 white squares rendered upon a black background. Whenever the user moves the mouse along the x-axis, each square's colour gradient is altered, and the canvas is rotated. The program has next to none practical functionality, and therefore it's mere existence is to be regarded as an error.
This is the code that makes up the program

# The coding process
My coding process was largely driven by frantic amounts of coffee, and shameless over-abuse of Google. I was intially planning to make the squares rotate around their own center, and rescale, when the user moved the mouse across the x-axis. After a couple of hours of relentless self-abuse facilitated by my evergrowing awareness of my own current incompetence, i surrendered to the program as it is, in it's current state. 
Instead of the squares rotating around their own center, the canvas rotates in a magically delightful way, that perfectly depicts my current understanding and mastery of P5: Ever confusing and unctrollabe, with no discernible goal or function.
# What constitutes a program?
I think a program is constituated of different sequences of instructions, that can be read or executed, as to make something behave in a controlled order of fashion.
# Reflect on the notion of error.
Something that unintentionally deviates from the current plan or guideline. An error can in many ways be harmful a fast and efficient experience, but can also be a great tool of learning. In my work with the current program, i learned alot more from the instants in which my code was faulty, rather than when everything went as planned. As Andy Weir writes in "The Martian": "I guess you could call it a "failure", but I prefer the term "learning experience""
