#BouncyMcBounceFace
The program has multiple internal feedback mechanisms, as it communicates with itself continually, as the ball bounces off of the different walls. Each wall has a feedback mechanism that alters the program as a whole, and hereby possesses an indirect control of information.

I tinkered alot with several different forms of feedback, for example the unfinished sliders that are included in this version of the project. I didn't have the time to implement or finish these functions, but decided to upload it in its current state anyway.
