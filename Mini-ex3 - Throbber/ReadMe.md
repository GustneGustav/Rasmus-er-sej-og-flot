# My Throbber design
[RunMe](https://goo.gl/l3Ueek)

The design of my Throbber is largely inspired by the current political climate, and how Putin is constantly pushing the boundaries of the world's politicians. In doing so he is currently forcing especially Doland Drumpf to act upon his passive-aggression, and therefore has Drumpf is depictured as revolving around Putin.
My initial idea was to have them constantly change in size in an interdependent relationship, controlled by Boolean variables. Alas. After several hours of crying and contemplation of life in a fetal position i caved in to my incompetence, and blatantly accepted the fact that i am failure.
In other news i also decided to have Rule Brittania playing in the background of my composition, because we all hope that Drumpf will one day make America Great Brittain again.
