# Starfield
This program is a Starfield inspired by the [coding challenge video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM) by Daniel Shiffman.
In my code i have added a function, that makes the starfield move according to the users mouse.
### What is the difficulty of this week's mini exercise?
I didn't find it particularly difficult as i could use the dear Shiffman's instructions. But the fact that it wasn't necessarily difficult didn't make it less useful. I learn a lot from following his instructions and trying to understand the steps of his guides.
### How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow-chart?
It definetely forces you to think a lot more about the code and how you structure it. You are forced to understand it from an independent onlooker's perspective which makes you think differently about how you organize the code in order to make it easier to comprehend. I wouldn't say you dumb the code down, but you definetely make an effort to make it easier to understand.
# Edit: I now realize i missed the opportunity to call my work Starfield Gone Garfield, and use Garfield as the stars. I am a failure.
