#Functionality
I was inspired by our dear presidents apparent love of arbitrary executive orders, and thought i would make a program that could compete with his creative outbursts. To do this i used Rita's Grammar functionality, that stores categorized sentences or words, and puts them out in the order you program it to.
Working with found text can in some cases be rather difficult. I was rather limited on time, and therefore wasn't able to make a more elegant solution, as to how i merge the text. There are some static elements, for example the introductory: "Executive order..." If i had more time, i would create a textpassage, that could fit semantically, with every found text-element, as the challenge is to find several components capable of following the same text-passages while being sensible semantically and grammatically.
#How might we think about the materiality of text/interface?
